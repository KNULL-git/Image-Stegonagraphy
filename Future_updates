Adding more features to your image steganography code can enhance its functionality and make it more interesting. Here are some ideas for additional features you could consider implementing:

1. **Multiple Image Formats:**
   Allow your code to work with various image formats, not just one. This could include popular formats like JPEG, PNG, or GIF. Make sure to adapt your steganography techniques accordingly.

2. **Encryption:**
   Add an encryption layer to your steganography process to make the hidden information more secure. This could involve encrypting the data before embedding it in the image.

3. **Password Protection:**
   Implement a password or key-based system to protect the hidden information. Users would need a password or key to extract the hidden content from the image.

4. **Text and File Support:**
   Extend your steganography capabilities beyond images. Allow users to hide and extract text or even files (e.g., documents, PDFs) within images.

5. **Randomization:**
   Introduce a randomization element to your code to make it more robust against detection. Randomly selecting pixels or modifying the embedding process can add an extra layer of security.

6. **Compression:**
   Implement compression techniques to reduce the size of the hidden data before embedding it. This can help minimize the impact on the image and make the steganography process more efficient.

7. **GUI (Graphical User Interface):**
   Develop a user-friendly GUI for your steganography tool. This can make it more accessible to users who may not be comfortable with command-line interfaces.

8. **Decoy Message:**
   Include an option to add a decoy message or data along with the hidden information. This could mislead anyone attempting to analyze the image for hidden content.

9. **Metadata Handling:**
   Be mindful of image metadata (EXIF data) that may reveal information about the image. Ensure that your steganography process does not inadvertently alter or reveal sensitive metadata.

10. **Anti-Forensics Techniques:**
    Explore techniques to make your steganography more resistant to forensic analysis. This could involve countermeasures against statistical attacks or other detection methods.

11. **Error Handling and Robustness:**
    Improve the error handling in your code to gracefully handle different scenarios, such as incorrect passwords, corrupted images, or incompatible file formats.

12. **Integration with Cryptographic Libraries:**
    Leverage existing cryptographic libraries to enhance the security of your steganography implementation. Consider using libraries like PyCryptodome or cryptography.

Remember to thoroughly test any new features you add to ensure that they work correctly and do not compromise the effectiveness or security of your steganography tool. Additionally, always respect legal and ethical considerations when working with tools that involve hiding or encrypting information.
